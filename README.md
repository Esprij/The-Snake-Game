# The-Snake-Game
Atari's Snake Game recreated using Python's Turtle module &amp; some advanced methods.


## Technologies/Libraries & Modules used:
<li>Turtle</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Class Inheritence</li>
<li>Adv. Objects</li>

## What was Learned/Practiced:
The main subject was Class Inheritence & Adv. Objects,<br> we inherited the Turtle class into our Scoreboard & Food classes to crate advanced objects who are responsible for essential functional components within the game.

## The program composes of 3 classes:
1. Food
2. Scoreboard
3. Snake

### Class: Food
This class is responsible for generating the food object in the screen, a turtle from the Turtle class is used to create the food as well as move/refresh the foodâ€™s location. The class is composed of 1 method: .refresh()
